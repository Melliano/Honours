<b>A self parking car via a Neural Network</b>
</h1>
This is my current ongoing Honours year project that involves creating an Artifical Neural Network to self park a car under a range of different scenarios. The enviroment has been made through the use of the LibGDX framework to emulate a 2D space and the physics of a car in real world situations
